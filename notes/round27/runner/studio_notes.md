# Studio notes

Observations of the canvas, the paint and the tools at this easel, by
operation: what was done, what the paint did and, where it's known, why.
Each was seen under particular conditions and may be incomplete or wrong.
They describe the easel; they aren't instructions. Widths and positions
are in canvas units (the canvas is 1000 units wide).

## The canvas and ground

1. The linen's vertical threads are more even than the horizontal ones,
   which carry thick slubs a few millimeters long; their spacing follows the
   counts set in `canvas{}`.
2. The ground chosen in `canvas{}` shows through thin paint; body color
   hides it.
3. Light paint laid at light pressure over a wet dark catches only the high
   points of a knife-textured ground. The dark stays in the hollows as a
   net of fine dark lines that looks like cracking.
4. Bristles plough paint off the tops of the weave, so a lay-in can keep
   small specks of bare ground. A denser pass covers them.

## Paint in thin films

5. A coat of paint over paint of its own masstone looks the same at any
   thickness, so a mark from a pile matching what it lies on disappears
   into it.
6. A thin film doesn't look like its pile. Thin dark or earth mixtures over
   a pale passage come out lighter, warmer and more saturated than the
   masstone on the palette.
7. The thin fringe of an umber or black stroke over a light field dries
   as a warm brown to warm gray halo. A blue stroke's fringe stays blue.
8. Lead white hides strongly (its hiding in the guide's tube table is
   0.82; how much a coat covers also depends on its thickness). A thin veil of a pale
   lead-white mixture veils and lightens what is under it, like a scumble,
   rather than tinting it.

## Brushes

9. Every brush is blunt unless given a `point`. A blunt brush's mark runs
   from about half its width at the lightest touch to its full width pressed
   (a little more with splay), so it can't taper to a point.
10. A pointed brush at light pressure lays a hairline, and its width grows
    with pressure. A band a few units wide needs real pressure or a blunt
    brush of that width. A stroke whose pressure falls off at the end draws
    down to the tip and still reaches the end of its path.
11. A brush keeps its paint across strokes. Each stroke lays most at its
    start, and the load runs down along the stroke, so a long drag with a
    wide brush runs dry partway and leaves thinly covered streaks and bands.
12. A well-loaded hair wets the hollows of the weave. A nearly empty one
    skims the tops (dry brush, broken color). Soft hair bends down into the
    hollows; stiff bristle rides on the tops.
13. Whether a dry brush breaks up depends on its load, the pressure, the
    paint below and the ground's texture.
14. A pointed brush loaded below about a quarter stops wetting the hollows,
    and its thin line breaks up along the weave. Run dry, the tip loses its
    point and splits.
15. A pressed touch lays one continuous, nearly round patch (the paint
    bridges the hairs) that grows with pressure.

## Strokes, passes and clipping

16. `clip=true` stops every bristle on the mask's edge, weighted by the
    mask's value. A clipped fill reproduces the mask's outline exactly, as
    one even line, steps and corners included. The `detail` and `blend`
    hands are clipped by default. `broad`, `body`, `hatch`, `glaze` and
    `scumble` are not.
17. Unclipped strokes run past the mask's edge by their own length and
    width. Along a long straight edge they throw small irregular patches into the field
    beyond, and a brush wider than a band spreads well outside it.
18. The square ends of unclipped strokes notch a shape's edge into steps.
19. In `work`, the mask's value decides where strokes are anchored (at or
    above `threshold`: 0.3, or 0.1 for `detail`). Unclipped, a soft mask
    edge doesn't make a soft paint edge; strokes end where their lengths
    end.
20. `work` leaves the ground showing between its strokes. With `fill=true`
    it looks at its passage afterward and dabs paint into the bare spots its
    strokes left. Single `stroke` and `touch` calls don't fill in.
21. Short strokes planned along a band about one unit wide come out as a
    dashed line: the planner lays them separately, with gaps.
22. Parallel strokes that all break at the same places leave a row of stroke
    ends across the passage, and the outer strokes' ends make a lobed edge.
23. `cut_in` with a round along a curved edge lays short strokes that follow
    it as a string of small bumps.
24. In a smooth lean passage, the loaded starts of broad strokes stay as
    lighter patches. Blending reduces them but doesn't remove them.

## Wet into wet

25. A brush over open paint lifts some of it and mixes it with its own. A
    clean brush lifts wet paint, less as it sets, and nothing from set or
    dry paint.
26. Light touches into a wet dark dissolve into it. The same touches on
    paint that has set stay where they land.
27. A pale stroke dragged through a wet dark picks up the dark and comes out
    streaked, grayer and less opaque, so what is underneath shows.
28. A dark stroke laid into a wet pale passage lifts the pale and comes out
    paler than its pile.
29. A passage laid against a wet neighbor drags the neighbor into its edge.
30. Crossing strokes in wet paint thin each other at the crossings, and the
    layer below shows there.
31. A tacky surface grabs: a brush dragged over it leaves its paint sooner
    and in broken patches (stick and slip).

## Stippling

32. Touches into a wet layer lift some of it and fuse. On a dry layer each
    touch stays separate.
33. One dip serves one small patch of touches (24 by default), and each
    dip's mixture varies a little. On a dry layer the passage can dry as a
    patchwork of slightly different patches; fewer touches per dip make the
    patches smaller.
34. Coverage is how many touches fall on each point; one touch covers about
    π(0.4 × width)².
35. Contrast with what is underneath decides how a stipple reads. A coverage
    that gives a veil over a mid tone gives solid patches over a pale field.
36. With `feather` above 0, touches press lighter where coverage falls
    below 1, so a thinning stipple ends in smaller, fainter marks; at 0 they
    keep their pressure.
37. A row of separate touches along a thin line reads as a string of beads.
    A short dragged stroke along it reads as one continuous ridge.

## Blending

38. The blender fuses open paint by lifting it and moving it. It can't move
    set or dry paint.
39. `blend` stays inside its mask by default. Unclipped, it drags wet paint
    across the mask's edge.
    A local blend can leave a seam where lifted or moved paint meets the
    untouched paint outside that mask. A soft mask does not prevent wet
    dark and light passages inside it from mixing.
40. Touches stippled into a wet layer and then blended fuse into it. Only
    the strongest contrasts survive, as thin traces. Touches laid after the
    blending pass stay on top as a lacy texture.
41. Repeated blending of one lean layer lifts paint off the tops of the
    weave, and the ground shows through as a pale lattice.
42. Blending spreads each thin spot in a layer into a soft-edged patch.

## Glazing

43. A brushed glaze (`hand="glaze"`) isn't clipped.

## Masks

44. Every mask covers the whole canvas. A mask function that isn't zero far
    from the spot you mean paints there too.
45. Masks from shapes (`poly`, `rect`, `ellipse`, `ribbon`) are crisp.
    `soften` and `blur` give them a ramp. `roughen` replaces the ramp with a
    new edge at the 0.5 level, so a long soft fade comes back as a hard
    edge.
46. `ribbon` puts a round disc at every point, both ends included, so it
    reaches half a width past its end points.
47. Two separately softened masks that meet leave a light gap or a dark
    overlap along the seam. A mask and its inverse (`m` and `-m`) meet
    without one.
48. A passage bounded by a mask shows a cut edge wherever its paint differs
    from its neighbor's at the mask's edge.

## Drying and time

49. Paint goes from open (workable) to setting, tacky and touch-dry.
    Drying depends on pigment, thickness and oil; the guide describes
    the times at this easel.
50. `wait` ages every point of the canvas at once. Which passages have set
    depends on their pigment, thickness and oil, not on where you worked.
51. A long pass is painted in 15-minute slices that age
    between them, so its first part is older than its last. While the work
    goes on, the paint under a later passage is still open and comes up
    into it.

## Pencil

52. Graphite doesn't take on wet paint, and paint laid over it seals it.
    Thin paint lets a line show and body color hides it. Under a thin first
    layer a firm line reads as a thin dark line until a fuller layer covers
    it.
